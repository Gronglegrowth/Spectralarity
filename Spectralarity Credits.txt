Spectralarity - Credits and Acknowledgements

This modpack would not be a thing without the influence, help, and inspiration, of several people and things, of which this file is dedicated to listing.

Credits:
- The logo uses the various dike runes within Spectrum's textures. These were made entirely by Azzyypaaras, to whom full credit for them is given.

Acknowledgements:

Perhaps primarily, Spectralarity would not exist were it not for my discovery and enjoyment of the modpack DragonRealm by Reika Kalseki - my experiences with it inspired me to experiment with designing my own progression packs, hoping to, even if loosely, follow in its footsteps.

Secondly, Spectralarity began life as an edit of Spectrachromancy, a far more ambitious and troublesome-to-make challenging puzzle of a modpack focused around Spectrum. Spectrachromancy's design, though it has bore no fruit (yet?), was greatly aided by fraZ0R, whom provided countless ideas.

Thirdly, to the members of Blawg, of whom Spectralarity's initial versions and mod choices were made for the server of.

Fourthly, without all of the mod authors whose excellent work composes the core of the pack, there would be no pack.

Fifthly, the Spectrum community. A truly wonderful place brimming with wonderful people, some of whom are directly responsible for certain features within Spectralarity.

Finally, you - what is a work of art without someone to experience it? Knowing that my work is being experienced, being (hopefully) enjoyed and appreciated, is a good thing and brings joy.
