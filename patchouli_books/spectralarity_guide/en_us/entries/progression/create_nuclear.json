If I am to truly industrialize my base, I ought to look into a new way of getting power.$(br2)  Lately, I have been considering the thorium I can find in the Nether. It's radioactive, and so I may be able to use it to heat steam engines... and other things. But... how do I construct a suitable nuclear reactor?"
