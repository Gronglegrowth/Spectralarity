Just being in its presence is enough to charge the air with remnants of some sort of energy. Whatever this monolith is, it seems dormant now, and may prove valuable for salvage - though you can't quite shake off a feeling of unease...."

When you touched your Paintbrush to what you correctly assumed was its core, the thing merely sent a shock of *something* your way - you're lucky to be able to write legibly. Perhaps, though, this was its way of signaling something? Maybe it would react differently to, say, your magical pigments?"
